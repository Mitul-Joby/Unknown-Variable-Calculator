## About
The program supports a variety of two and three dimensional shapes. Simply select the required shape, choose the operation, select the unknown variable to find and enter the known values. If any value which is required for calculation the unknown, the program shall prompt the user for the necessary.

The program contains a notes tab for saving necessary information found fit for the user , such as results of a series of regular shapes can be saved to find the area of an irregular shape or formulas for other shapes, etc.

The program also contains a calculator which can perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
